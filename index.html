      <h3>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</h3>
  <p>the proposed system offers an electronic transaction framework based on consensus mechanisms, eliminating the need for trust and central authority utilizing cryptographic proof instead of trust. The paper outlines a solution to the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted third party. It introduces a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions through a proof-of-work mechanism, ensuring security and immutability. The paper explains the process of transactions, the use of proof-of-work, network operations, incentives for network participants, and methods for privacy and verification. Through a series of calculations, the paper demonstrates the system's resilience against potential attacks. </p>

  <h3>HBasechainDB â€“ A Scalable Blockchain Framework on Hadoop Ecosystem</h3>
  <p>The paper introduces HBasechainDB, a scalable blockchain framework integrated with the Hadoop ecosystem. It addresses the scalability issues of traditional blockchains by leveraging HBase, a distributed database system. HBasechainDB combines the immutability and decentralization of blockchain with the efficiency and scalability of Hadoop. It allows for tamper-proof, decentralized storage of big data while supporting high-throughput transaction processing. The implementation details involve pushing computation to the data nodes, ensuring linear scaling. Experimental results demonstrate the system's scalability and performance, making it a promising solution for businesses dealing with large volumes of data.</p>

  <h3>Towards Privacy-Preserving Cloud Storage: A Blockchain Approach</h3>
  <p>The paper "Towards Privacy-Preserving Cloud Storage: A Blockchain Approach" proposes a data protection scheme called BC-PECK, leveraging blockchain and public key searchable encryption. It encrypts data and stores it in the cloud while establishing a ciphertext index on the blockchain. Smart contracts control data access and sharing, ensuring fairness and security. The scheme addresses privacy concerns in cloud storage and supports multi-keyword queries, enhancing usability. Security analysis confirms confidentiality and fairness, while performance evaluation shows feasibility and efficiency. The scheme combines privacy protection with blockchain's credibility, offering a promising solution for secure cloud storage.</p>
